# Material for the Oldenburg MNE-Python workshop 2025

Authors of the material:

## Before you arrive

Please make sure you do the following steps before the first hands-on session:

0. You will need to have an up-to-date version of MNE-Python installed on your machine (you need a *full install* with all dependencies, **not** "MNE-Python with core functionalities only"). See instructions at: https://mne.tools/stable/install/index.html. You can either use the standalone installer or install via `conda`. This will also automatically install Python and other necessary packages to your computer.
1. To check your installation, please look at the (very short!) notebook [Check your installation](installation_check/0-Installation_check.ipynb). See below if you need a reminder how to start it.
2. Download the data. You can do this with a notebook in the same folder: [Download data](installation_check/1-Download_data.ipynb).
3. Before the workshop, the notebooks for the workshop will be added. Please also download these.

### Start a Jupyter notebook

 Jupyter was installed alongside MNE-Python in step 0 above. To start a Jupyter notebook, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the notebook. Then type the command `jupyter notebook` and Jupyter should open in your internet browser. Click on the notebook you want to run and it will open! You can now run the cells in the notebook one-by-one.
 If you would like some extra information on Jupyter notebooks and how to use them, check out the [Jupyter notebook documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html).

### Do I need an IDE?

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment and is a program that you can use to develop _and_ run your code. For this workshop, we will be exclusively using Jupyter notebooks (see above), so you don't need to install an IDE if you do not have one yet.
